**Cortado is a process mining tool dedicated for interactive/incremental process discovery**

This is a fork of the main repository implementing **UNFOLDING-BASED ALIGNMENTS** - a work within a Master's thesis on - '_Partial Order-based Alignments via Petri net Unfolding_'

It replaces the sequentialization-based conformance checking in Cortado with unfolding-based alignments along with additional features. 

## Overview Functionality

- Variant-wise interactive visualisation of missing and undesired events and dependencies
- Order-aware conformance status
- Number of _completely_ fitting traces and variants

## Downloads

**Standalone builds** for **Windows 10/11**, **Linux**, and **macOS** (Apple Silicon only) are available from the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/cortado-tool/cortado/releases).

## Repository Structure 

All the relevant changes for unfolding-based alignments can be found in https://github.com/cortado-tool/cortado/compare/main...ariba-work:cortado:main
